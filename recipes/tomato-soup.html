        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tomato soup is a classic and comforting dish, typically made from ripe tomatoes as its primary ingredient. It can range in style from a light, clear broth to a thick, creamy bisque. Often seasoned with herbs like basil or oregano, and sometimes enriched with cream, butter, or stock, tomato soup offers a balance of tangy, sweet, and savory flavors. It's a versatile soup that can be enjoyed hot or cold, often served as an appetizer, a light lunch, or paired famously with a grilled cheese sandwich for a beloved comfort food combination.</p>
        <h2>List Of Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Canned crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, or whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano are often preferred for their sweetness and low acidity).
</li>
            <li>
</li>
            <li>Onion (yellow or white), chopped.</li>
            <li>Garlic, minced.</li>
            <li>Olive oil or butter, for sautéing.</li>
            <li>Vegetable broth or chicken broth/stock.</li>
            <li>Water (less flavorful, but can be used).</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Fresh basil (a classic pairing with tomato).</li>
            <li>Dried oregano or Italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bay leaf.</li>
            <li>A pinch of sugar.</li>
            <li>Maple syrup or honey.
</li>
            <li>A splash of balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar.</li>
            <li>Heavy cream or half-and-half (for a creamy tomato soup).</li>    
            <li>Milk (lighter alternative to cream).</li>
            <li>Butter (stirred in at the end for richness).</li>
            <li>Coconut milk (for a dairy-free creamy option).</li>
            <li>Parmesan rind (simmered in the soup for umami depth).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps To Follow </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil or melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion (and diced carrot/celery, if using). Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
            <li>Stir in the canned crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, salt, black pepper, sugar, and dried herbs (oregano/Italian seasoning and bay leaves, if using).</li>
            <li>Stir everything together well.</li>
            <li>Bring the soup to a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot partially (leaving a small gap for steam to escape), and let it simmer for at least 20-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and deepen. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>If using an immersion blender: Carefully insert the immersion blender into the pot and blend until the soup is smooth to your desired consistency. Be cautious of hot splatters.</li>
            <li>If using a standard blender: Carefully transfer the hot soup in batches to your blender. Do not fill the blender more than halfway. Secure the lid, holding it down with a kitchen towel, and start blending on low speed, gradually increasing to high. Blend until smooth. Pour the blended soup back into the pot.</li>
            <li>If making creamy tomato soup, stir in the heavy cream or half-and-half at this stage. Heat gently for a few minutes until warmed through, but do not boil after adding cream.</li>
            <li>Taste the soup and adjust seasonings as needed. You might want more salt, pepper, or a pinch more sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic. Remove bay leaves if used.</li>
            <li>Ladle the hot tomato soup into bowls.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, croutons, a swirl of cream, or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, as desired.
</li>
            <li>Tomato soup is famously delicious served with a grilled cheese sandwich!</li>
