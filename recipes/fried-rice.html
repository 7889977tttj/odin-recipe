        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Egg fried rice is a beloved Asian staple, characterized by its comforting simplicity and savory depth. It typically features day-old cooked rice stir-fried at high heat with scrambled egg, various vegetables like peas and carrots, and often a protein such as chicken or shrimp. The magic happens in the wok, where the ingredients are tossed rapidly, allowing the rice grains to achieve a slightly crispy texture while absorbing the rich flavors from soy sauce, sesame oil, and other seasonings, culminating in a satisfying and highly customizable one-dish meal.
        </p>
        <h2>List Of Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooked Rice:</strong> Ideally, day-old, chilled, cooked medium-grain or long-grain white rice (like jasmine or basmati). Using cold, slightly dried-out rice prevents stickiness and allows for better separation and crisping.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Large eggs, typically 2-3 per serving, lightly beaten.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> High smoke point oil such as vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, or grapeseed oil, for stir-frying.</li>
            <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Light soy sauce is standard for umami and seasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame Oil:</strong> Toasted sesame oil, added at the end for its distinctive nutty aroma and flavor.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps To Follow</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure your cooked rice is cold and ideally, has been refrigerated for at least a few hours or overnight. Break up any large clumps with your hands.
</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Chop all your vegetables and any optional protein so they are ready to go. Stir-frying is very fast!</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, and oyster sauce (if using). This is your sauce blend.
</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok or skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beaten eggs. As they set, gently push them around with your spatula to create soft, scrambled curds.
</li>
            <li>Once cooked through but still tender, remove the eggs from the wok and set aside on a plate. You don't want to overcook them at this stage.</li>
            <li>Add another 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok, increasing the heat to high.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Add the diced carrots and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until slightly softened.</li>
            <li><Add the peas and chopped onion (or white parts of scallions). Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant and slightly tender-crisp./li>
            <li>If using garlic or ginger, add them now and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn them.
</li>
            <li>If using cooked chicken, shrimp, or other protein, add it to the wok with the vegetables and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes to heat through.
</li>
            <li>Push the vegetables (and protein) to one side of the wok. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the empty side.
</li>
            <li>Add the cold rice to the wok. Using your spatula, break up any remaining clumps and spread the rice out in an even layer to get some slight charring.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry the rice vigorously for 2-3 minutes, tossing constantly, until the grains are separated and heated through, and some are lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked scrambled eggs back into the wok with the rice and vegetables.</li>
            <li>If using white pepper, sprinkle it in now.
</li>
            <li>Continue to stir-fry and toss everything together for another 1-2 minutes, ensuring the sauce is evenly distributed and the rice is coated and hot.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the egg fried rice to serving bowls.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped green parts of scallions and fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve immediately.
</li>
        </ol>
